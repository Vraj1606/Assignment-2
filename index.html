                With you between my arms<br>
                Barefoot on the grass<br>
                Listening to our favourite song<br>
                When you said you looked a mess<br>
                I whispered underneath my breath<br>
                But you heard it<br>

                I know we'll be alright this time<br>
                Darling, just hold my hand<br>
